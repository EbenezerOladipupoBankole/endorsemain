# Endorse App - Demo Walkthrough Script

## **Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)**
"Hi everyone, today I’m going to show you **Endorse**, a seamless document signing application designed for speed and simplicity. Whether you have a PDF or a Word document, Endorse makes it easy to sign, complete, and share your important files securely."

---

## **Step 1: The Dashboard (0:30 - 1:00)**
*Action: Start on the Dashboard page.*

"Here we are on the **Dashboard**. As you can see, it provides a clean overview of my activity.
- On the left (or top), I can see my usage limits and plan status.
- In the center, I have quick stats: Total Documents, Signed, and Pending.
- And below, I have a list of my **Recent Documents** so I can quickly pick up where I left off."

## **Step 2: Uploading a Document (1:00 - 1:45)**
*Action: Click the 'New Document' button or drag a file into the upload area.*
*(Optional: Use a Word document to show off the conversion feature)*

"Let's start a new signing session. I can upload a PDF directly, but Endorse is smart—it also supports **Microsoft Word documents**.

I’m going to drag in this contract, which is a `.docx` file. You’ll notice the system instantly recognizes it and converts it to a secure PDF format automatically, ready for signing. No need for external tools."

---

## **Step 3: Signing the Document (1:45 - 2:30)**
*Action: The document loads in the viewer.*

"Now we are in the **Signing Interface**.
1.  First, I need a signature. I'll click **'Create Signature'** (or use the sidebar).
2.  I can draw my signature right here on the screen. Once I'm happy with it, I click **Save**.
3.  Now, I simply **click anywhere on the document** to place my signature.
4.  I can drag it to position it perfectly on the signature line."

*Action: Place the signature and adjust it.*

---

## **Step 4: Completion & Download (2:30 - 3:00)**
*Action: Click the 'Download Signed PDF' button.*

"Once the signature is placed, I’m done. I just click **'Download Signed PDF'**.
The system embeds my signature into the file and downloads the finalized, legally binding PDF document to my device."

---

## **Step 5: Inviting Others (Optional - Pro Feature) (3:00+)**
*Action: Mention the invite feature if you want to show it.*

"If I needed someone else to sign this, I could use the **'Send Invites'** feature to email them a secure link to this document, allowing us to collaborate asynchronously."

---

## **Closing**
"And that is Endorse—simple, professional document signing for everyone. Thank you!"
